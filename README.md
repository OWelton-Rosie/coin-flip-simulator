This program was to help with a stats assignment on the difference between experimental and theoretical probability. It helped a great deal by letting me do virtually unlimited simulations.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> I find that Zsh kills the process and my terminal crashes if I attempt more than 10,000,000,000 (10 billion) flips at a time. 
This is a hardware issue (I'm on a MacBook Air 2024), so if you have an extremely powerful computer, you'll be able to handle more flips at a time.
